# Energy Consumption Anomaly Detection â€“ TU Dortmund Case Study

## Overview

This project focuses on **anomaly detection in energy consumption time-series data** using deep learning models. It was developed as part of a case study at **TU Dortmund University**.

We implemented and compared three ML models to detect both **point anomalies** and **contextual anomalies** in energy data collected from multiple facilities.

### Models Implemented:

- **LSTM Autoencoder (LSTM AE)**
- **Temporal Convolutional Network Autoencoder (TCN AE)**
- **Deep Generative Hierarchical Latent Model (DGHL)**

## Business Context

Energy consumption data is critical for identifying inefficiencies and reducing carbon footprints.  
Anomalies in such data may indicate:

- Equipment malfunctions
- Abnormal usage patterns
- Sensor errors or data quality issues

Accurate anomaly detection helps organizations take **proactive measures to improve operational efficiency and sustainability**.
